# Technologies used 

* HTML

# Conclusion

It was satisfying working out how to generate the grid. I also added a range slider and color picker which worked well. Picked up some more CSS knowledge in this one, particularly CSS grid. 

# TODO 

* I want to add a 'mouse down' functionality where you click and hold and drag to draw instead of just hovering over the grid, this would make it easier to draw without erasing / overwriting previous work.
